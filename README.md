# MUD

A MUD (multi-user dungeon).

Clients connect like:

```
$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect example.com:2323
```

â€¦where `:2323` is the port number.

Generate a self-signed SSL/TLS key for the server:

```
openssl req -x510 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=Michigan/L=Detroit/O=MUD/OU=MUD/CN=localhost"
```
