# MUD

This is a dumb little from-scratch MUD (multi-user dungeon) just for me to noodle around with. Goals don't necessarily include producing a playable game.


## Connecting to the MUD

Clients connect like:

```
$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect example.com:2323
```

â€¦where `:2323` is the MUD's port number.


## Running the MUD Server

When running the MUD server, a a self-signed SSL/TLS cert can be generated like:

```
openssl req -x510 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=Michigan/L=Detroit/O=MUD/OU=MUD/CN=localhost"
```
